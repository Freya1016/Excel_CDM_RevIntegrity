# Excel_CDM_RevIntegrity
Excel mini-lab for Revenue Integrity analysis (CDM, contracts, charges, denials)

---

## 🎯 Business Problem
Hospitals face recurring risks in their revenue cycle:
- Duplicate charges  
- Mismatched revenue codes  
- Pricing inconsistencies  
- Denials linked to coding/contract misalignment  

These issues can lead to **revenue leakage, compliance risk, and operational inefficiency**.

---

## 🛠 Solution Approach
Using Excel, this project creates a **Revenue Integrity audit lab** that:  
- Reconciles charges against the CDM  
- Flags revenue code mismatches  
- Calculates and highlights price variance (±20% threshold)  
- Detects duplicate charges and late postings  
- Compares expected vs. actual reimbursement using payer contracts  
- Summarizes denials by CARC reason and department  

---

## 📊 Features
- **Audit_Checks tab** → automated exception flags  
- **Dashboard tab** → PivotTables and charts for quick insight  
- **KPI Cards** → Exception Rate, Avg Price Variance, Days to Post, $ at Risk  
- **Denials Heatmap** → CARC Reason × Department for root cause analysis  
- **Scenario Testing** → Late posting threshold toggle (3/7/14 days)

## 🚀 Next Steps
- ✅ Data files uploaded  
- ✅ Excel workbook included  
- 🔜 Add finalized Dashboard with PivotTables & charts  
- 🔜 Upload screenshots to `/outputs`  
- 🔜 Embed visuals here in README  

Stay tuned for more updates!
